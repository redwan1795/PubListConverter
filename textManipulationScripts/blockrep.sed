# filename: blockrep.sed
     #   author: Paolo Bonzini
     # Requires:
     #    (1) blocks to find and replace, e.g., findrep.txt
     #    (2) an input file to be changed, input.file
     #
     # blockrep.sed creates a second sed script, custom.sed,
     # to find the lines above the row of 4 hyphens, globally
     # replacing them with the lower block of text. GNU sed
     # is recommended but not required for this script.
     #
     # Loop on the first part, accumulating the `from' text
     # into the hold space.
